# Observation P6

Start time: 20:05

Training start time: 20:34

Does more testing to get to know the flying mechanism than other participants. Also uses the moment to fly up high and get an early overview over the race track.

"What the...!?", after spawning a difficult T-object task, where the exit portal was far left, had a relatively strong rotation, so that P6 has mostly a view on the right border of the exit portal, hiding a lot of the T-objects behind it. This is probably one of the hardest possible tasks, but still solveable by leaning several times to the left and right and re-grabing the T-object several times. But since the task has time pressure, people might not feel at ease taking longer for those more difficult tasks.


Study start time: 20:45

While standing in front of an entry portal, P6 is always first looking at the right border of the entry portal, and only then looking at the left side of the portal to trigger the start button. Is P6 confused every single time where the start button is?

Does care very little about collecting the coins in general, but even more so in Part 2, rather wants to be fast and get more rounds done.


Study end time: 20:58

P5 has a red forehead and a sweaty face after detaching the headset from his head.

End time: 21:06
