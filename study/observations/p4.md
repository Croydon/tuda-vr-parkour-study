# Observation P4

Start time: 16:30

Start time, training: 16:45

Took longer timer in training to get used to the controlls, but was then more precise as P3.

Study start time: 16:54

Moves around a lot with physical feets, even though the instruction was clearly to avoid this.

In the second race area, when the street is moving up the hill, P4 got stuck for a bit in the place, after the last coins, but before the task area. P4 had his right hand completely down, causing a vertical downwards force to be applied to strong to be countered by the forward force at first.

After the second tasks, P4 asked aloud "How was that again [with moving forward]?". Despite having done that in training and two times successfully and directly before that in two areas.
