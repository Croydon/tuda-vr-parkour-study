# Observation P5

Start time: 17:39

Study start time: 18:19

Moves around rather slowly, but is determinated to get all coins and does apparently well with that

After having spawned a difficult, but theoretical solvable T-object task:
"What is that? I can't see anything there. I can't reach that. Can I skip that? Yes, I am going to that now."
The exit portal was pretty close to the entry portal, and far right, hence the borders of both portals are blocking part of the view, making it more difficult, but with more patient, it would have been theoretically possible to see enough and solve it.

Study end time: 18:30

P5 has a red forehead and a sweaty face after detaching the headset from his head.
