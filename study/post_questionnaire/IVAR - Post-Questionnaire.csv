The coins seemed like they were very peculiar about how accurately you needed the headset to hit them.

some of the portals were at such extreme angles that it made the correct hand movement to get the object to rotate in a wanted direction very difficult to map in your brain. Some portals also hid parts of the objects behind their frame.
The height control was quite challenging when not used to it, especially changes between ascending and descending and hitting multiple coins in a slope."
