# Study Data for my IVAR Project

The implementation can be found here: https://github.com/Croydon/tuda-vr-parkour 

This repository contains several data of the performed pre-study and study:

  * Pre- and Post-Questionnaire questions and answers
    * I have only added the full questions, including explanations, in the `study/` directory, but those are identical for both the pre-study and the final study
    * All questions and explanations are translated to both English and German
  * Automatic logs
  * Non-exhaustive checklists for the study instructor to ensure that every participant gets the same information and tasks in the same order etc.
  * TODO: Digitalized observation notes taken during the study about behaviour and verbal remarks of participants

Here are some videos:
  * Study task walkthrough with real + VR view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9H1r-tjjA
  * Playlist of study participant task recordings: TODO
